A multinomial logistic regression was used to predict GPA ranges for students at International Islamic University Malaysia.  This data originated from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/shariful07/student-mental-health) and was specifically focused on factors that could be indicators of or contributors to mental health, such as depression or whether or not the individual was married.
